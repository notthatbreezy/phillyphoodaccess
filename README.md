PhillyPhoodAccess (or something)
===============================

Project Overview
---------------
One piece of a larger "liveability" application, this tool will show access to healthy food choices in your community and interesting recipes you can use with the ingredients you purchased.


Installation Notes
-----------------
Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/staterepme/phillyphoodaccess.git`

Copy `settings_example.py` to `settings.py`. Modify `settings.py` by searching for CHANGEME and changing the paths to your local repo.

To run the server, `cd` to the root directory (`phillyfoodaccess`) and rund `python manage.py runserver`. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8000. You should see `Hello, world` (or something other than an error) in the browser.
